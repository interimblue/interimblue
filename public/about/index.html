From individual lines of code to conceptual frameworks and later state of the art, research methods, I work at every level of the technology stack, Directly with engineers and scientist, all the way to CTO and heads of engineering. My main areas of focus are NLP Topics, MLOps and generative AI, especially around safety and evaluation.\nScience \u0026 Research Interests Anything that combines mathematics and the humanities / arts stirs my curiosity.\nFrom a technical lens I love and am trained in computational linguistics, so NLP, generative AI and anything to do with the algorithms around language and connection (graph representations) and more importantly, it’s use within the context of human behaviour is a point of fascination to me. One of my fondest memories was attending my first conference, which was the computational social science symposium in Zürich in 2019 At present, I am beginning to look more into AI, safety and guardrails as well as evaluation as a matter of urgency due to the sudden growth and wave of AI applications.\nHistory I graduated from the University of Manchester with a first in computer science in 2015. During my degree, I spent 12 months working full-time at JPMorgan Chase Along with the summer internship at Goldman Sachs in the trading technology division. During my bachelors, I found a passion graph science and graph/network algorithms. For my thesis, I Partnered with Professor David Wright, Hood and Professor Martin Everett of the social science Institute at University of Manchester, to develop a Java-based desktop application To analyse, social networks. I also developed a Monte Carlo based Algorithm for assessing centrality sensitivity - a means to assess the stability of a central note in a network.\nI moved to Berlin, Germany in 2015, where I worked as a software engineer at Signavio (now SAP) before moving on to become an IT consultant with CapGemini where I worked with BMW and Volkswagen. There I began working as prototyping engineer in Java for automotive enterprise software applications before moving up to a functional architect position. I left Capgemini as a lead consultant / Technical product owner Leading the rollout and development of several AWS based e-commerce platforms spanning multiple EU countries.\nIn 2019, I pivoted Back to academia and enrolled in an MSc Informatik program at TU Munich, with a focus on machine learning. My passion for combining machine learning with the humanities, led me to partner with the psychology department at LMO for a research project to analyse language evolution during the Covid pandemic.
