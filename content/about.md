##### Current
I am currently an AI Startup Solutions Architect at Amazon Web Services based in London, UK.

In this role I support UK based AWS AI start-ups to scale and grow their technology architecture and business by providing technical best practice guidance. My main areas of focus are NLP Topics, MLOps and generative AI, especially around safety and evaluation.
