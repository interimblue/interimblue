##### Current
I am currently an AI Startup Solutions Architect at Amazon Web Services based in London, UK.

In this role I support UK based AWS AI start-ups to scale and grow their technology architecture and business by providing technical best practice guidance. From individual lines of code to conceptual frameworks and later state of the art, research methods, I  work at every level of the technology  stack, Directly with engineers and scientist, all the way to CTO and heads of engineering. My main areas of focus are NLP Topics, MLOps and generative AI, especially around safety and evaluation.

##### Science & Research Interests

Anything that combines mathematics and the humanities / arts stirs my curiosity. 

From a technical lens I love and am trained in computational linguistics, so NLP, generative AI and anything to do with the algorithms around language and connection (graph representations) and more importantly, it's use within the context of human behaviour is a point of fascination to me. One of my fondest memories was attending my first conference, which was the [computational social science symposium in ZÃ¼rich in 2019 ](http://symposium.computationalsocialscience.eu/2019/)

At present, I am beginning to look more into AI, safety and guardrails as well as evaluation as a matter of urgency due to the sudden growth and wave of AI applications.

##### History

I graduated from the University of Manchester with a first in computer science in 2015. During my degree, I spent 12 months working full-time at JPMorgan Chase Along with the summer internship at  Goldman Sachs in the trading technology division. During my bachelors, I found a passion graph science and graph/network algorithms. For my thesis, I Partnered with Professor David Wright, Hood and Professor Martin Everett of the social science Institute at University of Manchester, to develop a Java-based desktop application To analyse, social networks. I also developed a Monte Carlo based Algorithm for assessing centrality sensitivity - a means to assess the stability of a central note in a network.

I moved to Berlin, Germany in 2015, where I worked as a software engineer at Signavio (now SAP) before moving on to become an IT consultant with CapGemini where I worked with BMW and Volkswagen. There I began working as prototyping engineer in Java for automotive enterprise software applications before moving up to a functional architect position. I left Capgemini as a lead consultant / Technical product owner Leading the rollout and development of several AWS based e-commerce platforms spanning multiple EU countries.

In 2019, I pivoted Back to academia and enrolled in an MSc Informatik program at TU Munich, with a focus on machine learning. My passion for combining machine learning with the humanities, led me to partner with the psychology department at LMO for a research project to analyse language evolution during the Covid pandemic. Doing this project, I discovered the beauty of topic modelling and went on to write a Master thesis I surveyed all available, topic, modelling methods and algorithms And developed a Framework on when to apply them Based on the data and context.
