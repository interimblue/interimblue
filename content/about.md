##### Current
I am currently an AI Startup Solutions Architect at Amazon Web Services based in London, UK.

In this role I support UK based AWS AI Startups to scale and grow their technology architecture and business by providing technical best practice guidance. Both at a technical level discussing code and the latest papers / state of the art methods, as well as at an executive C-level considering a technology's impact within the context of the business. My main areas of focus are NLP Topics, MLOps and generative AI, especially around safety and evaluation. 

More broadly I'm working to understand how to train and build tomorrow's AI systems safely, and exploring their responsible integration into human life.

Feel free to reach out to me for writing, speaking or other collaborative coding projects, or just to chat on any of the above.
